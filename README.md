# FileBridge
Often a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive is often overkiss,
sice I often find myself to just send files to myself via a messenger.
So the idea of FileBridge is a cloud storage service that is just a messenger.
You can Upload files or just send yourself a message with some text or link.
